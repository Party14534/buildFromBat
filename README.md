# Build From Bat

## Description
This program simplifies the creation of build scripts for C++ projects, streamlining the development process.

Leveraging the capabilities of std::filesystem and std::ifstream, this project manages the discovery and manipulation of directories and files required for the build process. These functionalities enhance the efficiency of the project setup and execution, contributing to a more streamlined workflow for C++ development.

## How to use
- **Run from Project's Root Directory:** Execute this tool from the highest-level directory of your project, the root directory.
- **Prepare 'project.txt':** Ensure there's a 'project.txt' file within the directory. This file should detail essential information like compiler flags, required libraries, and other configurations necessary for your project's successful build.
  - *Note*: If 'project.txt' isn't found in the execution directory, the tool will search for it in the directory that contains BuildFromBat.
- **Automated Build Setup:** BuildFromBat simplifies the process by creating a 'build' folder in the current directory if it doesn't exist already. It generates a .bat file within this folder. The resulting .bat file compiles the executable and places it into the 'build' folder for convenient access.

## Arguments
The program requires a single argument: the desired name for the output file.

```console
buildFromBat [output_file_name]
```

Replace `[output_file_name]` with your preferred name for the output file. This argument specifies the filename of the resulting executable generated by the build process.

## `project.txt` format
BuildFromBat interprets the `project.txt` file using key-value pairs, separated by '='

- **Each Key on a New Line**: Ensure each key-value pair resides on a separate line within the project.txt file.

Every key except compiler and system accept multiple occurrences in the `project.txt` file:

- **compiler:** Specifies the compiler invoked by the build process. Example: compiler=g++
- **flag:** Indicates additional compiler flags required for the build. Example: flag=Wall
- **includeDirectory:** Denotes the project's include directories. Example: includeDirectory=C:\path\to\folder\include
- **libraryDirectory:** Specifies directories containing project libraries. Example: libraryDirectory=C:\path\to\folder\lib
- **library:** Identifies libraries utilized by the compiler during the build. Example: library=Gl
- **exclude:** Identifies directories or files that should not be added to the build file. Example: exclude=build
- **system:** Identifies which system the user is using, currently the only
  system variable accepted is unix. Example: system=unix

Using this format in the project.txt file ensures proper parsing and interpretation by BuildFromBat, allowing for clear and customizable project configurations.

## Compiler Compatibility
BuildFromBat has primarily been tested and designed for use with the `g++` compiler. While it offers flexibility and ease of use specifically tailored for `g++`, it may not seamlessly function with other compilers out of the box.

**Note:** The tool's functionalities and configurations are optimized for `g++`, and compatibility with other compilers might require adjustments or modifications to suit their specific requirements. Testing and modifications may be necessary to adapt BuildFromBat for use with compilers other than `g++`.

## TODO
  I plan to continuously improve and expand this project to improve my skills as a programmer. Planned updates include:

  - **Custom Include Paths:** Upcoming updates will introduce the capability to include specific system paths, enabling their inclusion and search within the build file.
    - **Intended Use:** This feature aims to facilitate the inclusion of directories within your primary project. It will assist in scenarios where separate executable compilations within the project require files from sibling directories for compilation.

  - **Extended Compiler Support:** Future updates will introduce support for additional compilers like `cl`, `gcc`, `clang`, and various other popular compilers, enhancing the tool's compatibility and versatility.

  - **Expansion to Other Languages:** Long-term objectives involve extending support beyond C++ to encompass other compiled programming languages such as `C` and `Java`, broadening the tool's utility and applicability across diverse development environments.
